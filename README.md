## Code Overview

This repository contains several C++ and Verilog files that contribute to the functionality of the P2P on 5G project. Below is a brief overview of each file:

### C++ Files

- **backup.cpp**: Contains the implementation for creating backups of data in the P2P network.
- **icn.cpp**: Implements Information-Centric Networking (ICN) features within the P2P network.
- **join_trusted.cpp**: Manages the process for trusted nodes to join the P2P network.
- **join_untrusted.cpp**: Handles the joining process for untrusted or new nodes in the network.
- **load_balancing.cpp**: Provides the load balancing algorithm to distribute network traffic evenly.
- **p2p_on_5g.cpp**: The main file that integrates all P2P functionalities over the 5G network.
- **performance_power_scenario.cpp**: Analyzes different performance and power consumption scenarios in the network.
- **real_time_task.cpp**: Ensures real-time task management and scheduling within the network.
- **scheduling_algorithm.cpp**: Contains the scheduling algorithm for network tasks and resources.

### Verilog File

- **puf.v**: A Verilog file that implements a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) for security purposes.

### Encryption Algorithm

- **xchacha20.cpp**: Implements the XChaCha20 encryption algorithm for secure data transmission.

Each file is an integral part of the project, ensuring robustness, security, and efficiency in the P2P network over 5G. For more detailed information on each file, please refer to the comments and documentation within the code itself.
